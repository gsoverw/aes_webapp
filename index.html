                <h3>The AES Encryption algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetric block cipher 
                    algorithm with a block/chunk size of 128 bits. It converts these individual 
                    blocks using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Once it encrypts these blocks, it joins them together to form the ciphertext.
                    It is based on a substitution-permutation network, also known as an SP network. 
                    It consists of a series of linked operations, including replacing inputs with specific outputs (substitutions) and others involving bit shuffling (permutations).
                    In this tutorial, you will go through some of the standout features that AES offers as a globally standardized encryption algorithm. </h3>
